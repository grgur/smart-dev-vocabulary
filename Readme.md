# Smart Dev Vocabulary
This is a list of confusing terminology that will make you sound smart and your presentation, blogs, software advanced.

You can also use this as a practical translator for tech conferences. 

## Agnostic
When you don't really care what's going on around you. For example, device-agnostic apps should work on any smartphone out of the box. Don't confuse agnosticism for ignorance.

## Idempotent
Describes an operation or process that, when repeated, leaves a system in the same end state. For example, with POSIX tools, if you `rm -f README.md` the file `README.md` will be absent from the file system after you run this command, whether it was there before or not. This word is big in DevOps circles, good system provisioning scripts will leave the system in the desired state whether they start out running on a freshly installed system, or whether they have been run on a system that was provisioned with a previous version of the scripts.

## Idiomatic
Writing software using very specific language-specific guidelines or functionalities. Useful for those trying to write Java code in JavaScript.

## Isomorphic
Comes from a mathematical term **isomorphism**. Two objects are equal in form or shape if isomorphism exists between them. Kudos to whomever came up with that when isomorphic apps emerged. Dumbed down with term **universal**, to make it more understandable for the common folk. A welcome improvement ([thanks Michael Jackson](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.ckm0ema2p))

## Higher order
Functional programming technique of wrapping on object (e.g function) in another to enhance the functionality. You can higher order anything and it's fun to say for the people who struggle with the _R_ sound. 

## Holistic
Holistic approach to writing apps focuses on interdependence of components. Think of it as components mating to produce a new and improved functionality. 

## Pure (Functional)
A pure function can't modify any external global variables, change environment (think printing or input, db) etc. It is guaranteed to return same value for an input every single time; i.e. the answer doesn't depend on anything else than arguments.
